# Integrate PayPal directly with the Orders v2 API

This document outlines the <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/studio/checkout/standard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PayPal Checkout flow</a> and sample use cases.

## PayPal Checkout flow

A buyer following the PayPal Checkout flow has a PayPal account and uses payment methods like PayPal, Venmo, debit, and credit cards to pay for their order:

* Buyers are aware that PayPal is processing their payments.
* Buyers can pay for the order using any of the PayPal-associated payment methods.
* Payment sources for these orders can be PayPal, Venmo, PayPal Pay Later, debit card, or credit card.

![Flow diagram showing PayPal order processing steps: Create order with capture/authorize intent, optionally confirm payment source, capture or authorize based on intent, buyer approval, tracking, then patch or show order details](https://www.paypalobjects.com/ppdevdocs/orders-api/orders-api-standard-flow.png)

## Orders API flows using PayPal Checkout for Pay with PayPal

This section uses PayPal as the payment source to showcase the possible Orders v2 API flows in a PayPal Checkout integration.

> **Note:** All of the Orders v2 API endpoints are designed for merchants and partners. The payer only comes into picture during the approval or payer action required steps.

You need to pass an `intent` during the order creation. You can select either `CAPTURE` or `AUTHORIZE`:

* `CAPTURE`: Use this intent to capture a payment immediately after the buyer approves the purchase.
* `AUTHORIZE`: Use this option to authorize a buyer's funds before you capture payment and settle the purchase later. An authorization places a hold on the money and is valid for 29 days.

### Orders v2 API, detailed PayPal Checkout flow

![Sequence diagram showing PayPal checkout flow between consumers, merchant website, and PayPal. Consumer chooses PayPal (step 1), merchant creates order via API (step 2), consumer logs in and agrees to pay (steps 5-6), merchant redirects back after approval (step 7), retrieves order details (steps 8-9), and completes order (step 10). PayPal captures payment (steps 11-13). Diagram uses blue arrows for web interactions, pink arrows for API calls, and black arrows for PayPal internal processes.](https://www.paypalobjects.com/devdoc/ordersapi/standardcheckout/merchantwebsiteflow.png)

### Multi-step order flow with PayPal Checkout

There are 3 different ways to complete a PayPal Checkout payment:

#### PayPal Checkout with the payment source in a create order request

1. Create the order: pass the `payment_source` in the payload.
2. Payer action required: send the payer to the **Review your purchase** page.
3. Capture or authorize payment.
4. Set up shipment tracking for physical goods.

#### PayPal Checkout with the confirm payment source endpoint

1. Create the order.
2. Confirm the payment source: pass the `payment_source` in the payload.
3. Payer action required: send the payer to the **Review your purchase** page.
4. Capture order.
5. Set up shipment tracking for physical goods.

#### PayPal Checkout with the authorize order endpoint

Create the order.

1. Payer action required: send the payer to the **Review your purchase** page.
2. Authorize order.
3. Capture payment.
4. Set up shipment tracking for physical goods.

#### Other API endpoints

1. Get order details.
2. Update order details.

> **Note:** After you create an order, you have 3 hours to capture or modify that order. The order will remain in the `CREATED` state for only 3 hours. You can extend it up to 72 hours based on your use case. Connect with your TAM for more details.

## Prerequisites

If you are a first-time user who wants to know where to get your access token, how to use the API suite, and complete Postman setup details, refer to <a href="/developer/how-to/api/get-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get started with PayPal REST APIs</a>.

See PayPal's [Postman Collection](https://paypalcorp.postman.co/workspace/Test-Orders~269da256-27a0-4d00-9140-d9244798cb46/collection/31769881-80680620-c12a-4e9a-b496-a29cc1e9f1e8?action=share\&creator=31769881) for the latest Orders v2 API payloads.

> **Note:** Set up your server to call the Orders v2 API instead of making calls directly from the browser or the client-side.

## Sample JSON order request 1: Single-step order flow

This example uses PayPal as the payment source for creating a multi-step order. When the buyer chooses the payment method on the **Review Your Payment** (RYP) page and approves the purchase, you can capture the funds or authorize them for later, depending on the intent you choose during order creation.

### Step 1: Create order

Set the order `intent` to `AUTHORIZE` or `CAPTURE`. A successful request returns an HTTPS `200 OK` status code with a `payer-action-required` order status. The following code samples show both the `AUTHORIZE` and `CAPTURE` intents.

Sample create order request with intent `AUTHORIZE`:

### Include shipping details

Manage the shipping details for an order by including `shipping_preference` in the `experience_context` for the payment method defined in the `payment_source` object. For example, `payment_source.paypal.experience_context.shipping_preference` or `payment_source.venmo.experience_context.shipping_preference`.

The `shipping_preference` parameter accepts 3 options:

1. **Use buyer's PayPal shipping address (default):** When you set the `shipping_preference` parameter to `GET_FROM_FILE`, PayPal uses the buyer's shipping address directly from their PayPal account. This is the default option when there is no `shipping_preference` value.
2. **Ask buyer to provide address:** When you have the buyer’s address while creating the order and want to pass it as part of the request, add the `shipping_preference` field to `payment_source.paypal.experience_context` and set its value to `SET_FROM_PROVIDER`. You need to pass that address in the `purchase_units` section of the request. The following **Sample shipping request** payload shows how to include the shipping address. An important note: buyers cannot edit this address on the PayPal side.
3. **No shipping:** For digital goods or gift cards that have no physical delivery address, set the `shipping_preference` parameter to `NO_SHIPPING`.

See the <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/orders/v2/#definition-experience_context_base" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orders v2 API</a> for more information.

#### Sample shipping request

This sample request passes the shipping details using the the `purchase_units.shipping` object.

```bash lines expandable theme={null}
curl -v -X POST "https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com/v2/checkout/orders/"
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
-H 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS-TOKEN'
-d '{

                "currency_code": "USD",

                },
                "address": {
                  "address_line_1": "2211 N First Street",

                  "country_code": "US"
                }
           }
        }
    ],
    "payment_source": {
        "paypal": {
            "address": {
                "address_line_1": "2211 N First Street",
                "address_line_2": "17.3.160",
                "admin_area_1": "CA",
                "admin_area_2": "San Jose",
                "postal_code": "95131",
                "country_code": "US"
            },
            "email_address":"payer@example.com",
            "payment_method_preference": "IMMEDIATE_PAYMENT_REQUIRED",
            "experience_context": {
                "return_url": "https://example.com/returnUrl",
                "cancel_url": "https://example.com/cancelUrl",
                "shipping_preference": "SET_FROM_PROVIDER"
            }
        }
    }
}'
```

### Step 2: Buyer approval

After successfully creating the order, redirect the buyer to the RYP page. The Create order API response passes the RYP page URL as a HATEOS link using the `payer-action` parameter in the `links` section.

<Accordion title="See example buyer approval page">
  ![PayPal checkout page showing payment options including saved Visa card, PayPal Credit, and Pay in 4, with shipping address and total amount of \$100.00](https://www.paypalobjects.com/ppdevdocs/orders-api/orders-api-single-step-buyer-approval.png)
</Accordion>

When the buyer selects **Continue to Review Order**, they will be redirected to the `return_url` in the `experience_context` object. Replace it with the URL of the page where the buyer:

* Sees the final order amount.
* Reviews their final order.

**Continue to Review Order** is the default behavior. If you know the final order amount upfront while creating the order, such as shipping and taxes, and will not modify the order later, use the `PAY_NOW` flow to complete the payment in one go without requiring further action from the buyer on the merchant site.

Set this option in `paypal.experience_context.user_action`:

* `CONTINUE` is the default value for `user_action`.
* Choose `PAY_NOW` if you know the final amount before the buyer reaches the first review page.

### Step 3: Authorize or capture order

Both authorize and capture API requests accept `payment_source` as an input, but it's optional. See the preceding create order payload for the payment source. Learn more about <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/checkout/standard/customize/authorization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">authorize and capture</a>.

#### Capture order

After the order has been created and the payer approves the purchase, capture the order by sending a `POST` request and the order ID to the `/v2/checkout/orders/ORDER-ID/capture` endpoint. The following sample request and response show the result of sending a capture order request without a request body:

Sample capture order request:

Authorization requires an additional step to complete the payment.

Complete the authorization process and the transaction by sending a `POST` request to `v2/payments/authorizations/AUTHORIZATION-ID/capture` to call the <a href="/reference/api/rest/authorizations/capture-authorized-payment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capture authorized payment</a> endpoint of the Payments v2 API. This step triggers a call to the payment gateway to capture the payment.

> **Note:** You can authorize the total amount or a part of the total amount. To authorize a partial payment, pass the amount in the request payload. For more information, refer to the <a href="/reference/api/rest/authorizations/capture-authorized-payment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capture authorized payment</a> endpoint of the Payments v2 API.

The following sample request and response show the result of calling the capture API endpoint without a request body.

> **Note:** The Payments capture is not the Order capture call.

#### Step 4: Shipment tracking

If you have physical goods in your order, you can use the Shipment Tracking API to add tracking information to your packages, such as carrier, item, and SKU details.

* If the `intent` is set to `CAPTURE`, replace `CAPTURE-ID` with the `payments.captures.id` field that is found in the Order capture's API response.
* If the `intent` is set to `AUTHORIZE`, replace `CAPTURE-ID` with the ID field found in the Payment capture API response, not the Order API’s capture call.

The `capture_id` field is automatically populated if you're using the PayPal Postman collection.

> **Note:** See the <a href="/reference/api/rest/orders/add-tracking-information-for-an-order" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Add tracking information for an order</a> endpoint of the Orders v2 API for more information about each field in the payload.

#### Step 5: Show the order details

You can get the details of an order at any stage by sending a `GET` call to the <a href="/reference/api/rest/orders/show-order-details" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Show order details</a> endpoint of the Orders v2 API.

Sample show order details request with an authorization token:

  ```bash Request theme={null}
  curl -v -X GET "https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com/v2/checkout/orders/ORDER-ID" \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS-TOKEN'
  ```

### Sample JSON order request 2: Multi-step order flow with confirm order API endpoint

This example also demonstrates multi-step order creation using PayPal as the payment method. But unlike the preceding example, you can create an order without any payment source information. When the buyer chooses the payment method on the RYP page and approves the purchase, you can confirm their intent to pay, capture the funds, or authorize them for later, depending on the intent you choose during order creation.

#### Step 1: Create order

Set the order `intent` to `CAPTURE`. A successful capture order request returns an HTTPS `201 Created` status code:

Sample capture order request and response:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash lines expandable Request theme={null}
  curl -v -X POST "https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com/v2/checkout/orders/"
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS-TOKEN'

                      "quantity": "1",
                      "unit_amount": {
                          "currency_code": "USD",
                          "value": "100.00"
                      }
                  }
              ],
              "amount": {

                          "value": "100.00"
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
      ]
  }'
  ```

          }
      ]
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Step 2: Confirm payment

The buyer can confirm their intent to pay for the order using a PayPal Checkout payment source: in this case, PayPal.

> **Note:** The `payment_source` parameter is required.

Sample confirm payment request and response:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash lines expandable Request theme={null}
  curl -v -X POST "https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com/v2/checkout/orders/ORDER-ID/confirm-payment-source"
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS-TOKEN'
  -d '

    "payment_source": {

        "experience_context": {
          "payment_method_preference": "IMMEDIATE_PAYMENT_REQUIRED",
          "email_address": "payer@example.com",

      }
    }
  }'
  ```

                  "value": "100.00",
                  "breakdown": {
                      "item_total": {

              "items": [
                  {

                      },
                      "quantity": "1",
                      "description": "Green XL"
                  }
              ]
          }
      ],
      "links": [
          {
              "href": "https://api.sandbox.paypal.com/v2/checkout/orders/ORDER-ID",
              "rel": "self",
              "method": "GET"
          },
          {
              "href": "https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/checkoutnow?token=ORDER-ID",
              "rel": "payer-action",
              "method": "GET"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Step 3: Buyer approval

The buyer approves or cancels the payment in this step. For more information refer to **Step 2: Buyer Approval** in the preceding **Sample JSON order request 2: Multi-step order flow** section.

#### Step 4: Capture payment

The last step to complete the order is to capture the payment. You can capture an order without any payment source information.

> **Note:** If you want to provide the buyer with an option to change the payment source after the approval, you can pass the new payment method details in the Capture API call. However, this would need buyer approval again as it's a different payment source.

Sample capture payment request and response:

  curl -v -X POST "https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com/v2/checkout/orders/ORDER-ID/capture"

#### Step 5: Shipment tracking

If you have physical goods in your order, you can use the Shipment Tracking API to add tracking information to your packages, such as carrier, item, and SKU details. For more information, refer to **Step 4: Shipment tracking** in the preceding **Sample JSON order request 2: Multi-step order flow** section.

### Sample JSON order request 3: Multi-step order flow with authorize API

This is similar to the previous examples which pass the intent as `CAPTURE`, but you need to use one of the Payments v2 API endpoints to complete the order. For more details, refer to the “Authorize” example of **Step 3: Authorize or capture order** in the preceding **Sample JSON order request 2: Multi-step order flow** section.

#### Step 1: Create order

Set the order `intent` to `AUTHORIZE`. A successful capture order request returns an HTTPS `200 OK` status code.

#### Step 2: Buyer approval

The buyer approves or cancels the payment in this step. For more information refer to **Step 2: Buyer Approval** in the preceding **Sample JSON order request 2: Single-step order flow** section.

#### Step 3: Authorize order

An authorize order request accepts `payment_source` as an optional input, like a capture order request.

Sample authorize order request with payment source:

```bash lines expandable Request theme={null}
curl -v -X POST "https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com/v2/checkout/orders/"
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
-H 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS-TOKEN'
-d '{
    "intent": "AUTHORIZE",
    "purchase_units": [
        {
            "reference_id": "d9f80740-38f0-11e8-b467-0ed5f89f718b",
            "amount": {
                "currency_code": "USD",
                "value": "100.00"
            }
        }
    ],
    "payment_source": {
        "card": {
            "number": "1111111111111111",
             "expiry": "2028-12",
             "name": "Firstname Lastname",
            "billing_address": {
                "address_line_1": "123 Main St.",
                "admin_area_1": "CA",
                "admin_area_2": "Anytown",
                "postal_code": "12345",
                "country_code": "US"
            },
            "attributes": {
                "customer": {
                    "email_address": "payer@example.com",
                    "phone": {
                        "phone_number": {
                            "national_number": "5555555555"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}'
```

#### Step 4: Capture payment

Capture the authorized payment by calling the Capture authorized payment endpoint of the Payments v2 API using a `POST` request to `/v2/payments/authorizations/AUTHORIZATION-ID/capture`. Replace `AUTHORIZATION-ID` with the authorization ID returned in **Step 3: Authorize order**. This step triggers a call to the payment gateway to capture the payment.

> **Note:** The Payments capture is not the Order capture call, and the request body isn't mandatory.

#### Step 5: Shipment tracking

If you have physical goods in your order, you can use the Shipment Tracking API to add tracking information to your packages, such as carrier, item, and SKU details. For more information, refer to **Step 4: Shipment tracking** in the preceding **Sample JSON order request 2: Multi-step order flow**.

### Sample JSON order request 4: Pay with Venmo

The previous workflows and samples that used PayPal as the payment method also apply to Venmo. Use the same code samples, but change the `payment_source` to Venmo.

Sample create order request and response using Venmo:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash lines expandable Request theme={null}
  curl -v -X POST "https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com/v2/checkout/orders/"
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS-TOKEN'
  -d '
  {
      "intent": "CAPTURE",
      "purchase_units": [
          {
              "amount": {
                  "currency_code": "USD",
                  "value": "100.00"
              }
          }
      ],
      "payment_source": {
          "venmo": {
              "email_address": "payer@example.com",
              "experience_context": {
                  "shipping_preference": "GET_FROM_FILE",
                  "brand_name": "EXAMPLE INC"
              }
          }
      }
  }'
  ```

  ```json lines expandable Response theme={null}
  {
      "id": "ORDER-ID",
      "status": "PAYER_ACTION_REQUIRED",
      "payment_source": {
          "venmo": {
              "email_address": "payer@example.com"
          }
      },
      "links": [
          {
              "href": "https://api.sandbox.paypal.com/v2/checkout/orders/ORDER-ID",
              "rel": "self",
              "method": "GET"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```
