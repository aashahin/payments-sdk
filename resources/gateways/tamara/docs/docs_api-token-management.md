Generate your API Tokens directly from the portal for online and in-store API integrated merchants. This allows developers to access and use their tokens to send requests to **Tamara**. Only users with **Admin** role have access to this feature.

1. Login to the [Tamara Partners Portal](https://partners.tamara.co)
2. Go to **API Tokens** from the sidebar
3. Click on `Generate New Token +` from the top right corner
4. A pop-up confirmation will appear, read carefully and the click on **`I am aware, continue`**
5. Enter the OTP sent to the primary email address used to onboard **Tamara**
6. Once generated, the admin can copy and use this key to initiate transactions with Tamara.

> 🚧 Copy and download the keys, as they can’t be viewed again, and will need to generate a new set of tokens to view again.
